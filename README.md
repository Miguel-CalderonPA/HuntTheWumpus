# HuntTheWumpus
Quick Desc: Game where you try to grab the gold and be careful not to get eaten by the wumpus or fall in the pit. Do not worry, the game gives dynamic hints!

Features
- Actively gives hints to players
- Remembers previous locations
- Given ability to shoot the wumpus (default quantity set to 1) removing wumpus from board
